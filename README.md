# About the project

ms-course is a microservice back-end RESTful API project, from the course [DevSuperior](www.udemy.com/course/microsservicos-java-spring-cloud/).

The link for the teachers git [Teachers Project](https://github.com/acenelio/ms-course?tab=readme-ov-file).

The application deals with workers and their payments using very basic logic, since the main focus of the course and project was to learn about Spring Cloud and microservices architecture.

Since the course is a little outdated, I updated some of the technologies used in it:

- Hystrix --> Resliience4J
- Ribbon --> Spring Cloud Load Balancer
- Zuul   --> Spring Cloud Gateway
